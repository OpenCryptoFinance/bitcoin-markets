# Bitcoin Markets

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scientific papers that analyze Bitcoin markets using economical, financial and machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, you'd need to be able to write and understand Python code, I have written a book coined by one of its readers as the Bible of Python: [Python Programming: A Comprehensive Guide to Software Development with Real-World Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Comprehensive-Development-Application/dp/B0BW2G3W2R/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

You can purchase this book on Amazon to support its author and the author of this work in this repository.

### Overview

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that analyze Bitcoin markets using economical, financial and machine learning models.

You can find the full list of notebooks and models in here:

- [Integrating Interdisciplinary Models for Precise Forecasting of Bitcoin Market Prices: A Fusion of Financial, Economic, Time-Series, and Machine and Deep Learning Approaches](notebooks/Combining%20Financial,%20Economic,%20Time-Series,%20Mathematical%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20Models%20for%20Accurate%20Forecasting%20of%20Bitcoin%20Market%20Prices.ipynb)

- [Combining Economic Models for Bitcoin Market Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis](notebooks/Economic%20Models%20for%20Bitcoin%20Market%20Forecasting.ipynb)

We also develop a separate implementation and a separate notebook for each model in this project.

Our goal is to provide those models, datasets and analysis for the community.
