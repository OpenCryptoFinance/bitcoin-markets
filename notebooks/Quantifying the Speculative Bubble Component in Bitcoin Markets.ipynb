    "The first model we use is based on the standard framework for estimating the speculative bubble component in asset prices.

    "To estimate the fundamental component of Bitcoin prices, we use a range of economic indicators, including the hash rate, transaction volume, and mining difficulty.

    "- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models: Developed by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins in the 1970s.\n",
    "- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): The concept of artificial neural networks has its roots in the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in the 1940s. The development of modern neural networks, including backpropagation, can be attributed to multiple researchers including Paul Werbos in 1974, David Rumelhart and James McClelland in 1986, and Geoffrey Hinton in the 2000s.\n",
    "- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models: Developed by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1997.\n",
    "- Support Vector Regression (SVR) models: Developed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis in the 1990s.\n",
    "- Random Forest (RF) models: Developed by Leo Breiman in 2001.\n",
    "- Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN): Bayesian neural networks have been developed by multiple researchers including David MacKay in the 1990s and Radford Neal in 1995.\n",
    "- Vector Autoregression (VAR) models: Introduced by Clive Granger in the 1960s.\n",
    "- Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models: Developed by Robert Engle in the 1980s.\n",
