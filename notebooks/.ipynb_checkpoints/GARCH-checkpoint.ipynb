    "The GARCH model is a time series model that captures the dynamics of conditional volatility, where the variance of the error term at time $t$ is a function of the errors at previous times. The GARCH model is specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_t = \\mu_t + \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_t = \\sigma_t z_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_t^2 = \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\alpha_i \\epsilon_{t-i}^2 + \\sum_{j=1}^q \\beta_j \\sigma_{t-j}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_t$ is the time series at time $t$, $\\mu_t$ is the conditional mean of the time series, $\\epsilon_t$ is the error term at time $t$, $z_t$ is a random variable with a standard normal distribution, $\\sigma_t^2$ is the conditional variance of the error term at time $t$, $\\omega$ is a constant, $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_j$ are coefficients that determine the weight of the squared error terms and the past variances in the current variance, and $p$ and $q$ are the orders of the autoregressive and moving average terms, respectively.\n"
