    "# Markov regime-switching model: Developed by Andrew Harvey in the 1980s\n",
    "\n",
    "Boulouma A., 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov regime-switching model is a statistical model that allows for changes in the parameters of a time series model based on an unobserved Markov process. It is typically used to model data with non-constant volatility or mean, and is especially useful for financial time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model assumes that the observed data is generated by a switching process that follows a discrete-time Markov chain. At each point in time, the model switches between different regimes with different distributions, and the transition probabilities between regimes depend only on the current state of the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_t$ denote the observed data at time $t$, and let $s_t$ denote the unobserved state of the Markov chain at time $t$. The Markov regime-switching model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "y_t &= \\mu_{s_t} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n",
    "\\epsilon_t &\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{s_t}) \\\\\n",
    "s_t &\\sim \\text{Discrete}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{s_{t-1}})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_{s_t}$ and $\\sigma^2_{s_t}$ are the mean and variance parameters of regime $s_t$, $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{s_{t-1}}$ is the probability distribution of transitioning from regime $s_{t-1}$ to $s_t$, and $\\epsilon_t$ is an error term that is normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\\sigma^2_{s_t}$. The discrete distribution indicates that $s_t$ takes on a finite number of possible values."
